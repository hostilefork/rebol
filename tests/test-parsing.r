; Note: This doesn't rely on LOAD to break a file full of tests down into
; individual tests.  LOAD is only used on a per-test basis.  The reason this
; extra hassle was done is so that if the scanner has a problem on one test,
; it only shows failure on that test...not the whole file.  Whether this is
; worth it or not is debatable, but rewriting string escaping in a parse rule
; here is certainly not worth it.  So when it sees a `{` or a `"` it defers
; to TRANSCODE to parse that string.
