    Purpose: {
        Ren-C "officially" supports two executables for doing a bootstrap
        build.  One is a frozen "stable" version (`8994d23`) which was
        committed circa Dec-2018:

        https://github.com/metaeducation/ren-c/commit/dcc4cd03796ba2a422310b535cf01d2d11e545af

        The only other executable that is guaranteed to work is the *current*
        build.  This is ensured by doing a two-step build in the continuous
        integration, where 8994d23 is used to make the first one, and then
        the build is started over using that product.

        This shim is for 8994d23, in order to bring it up to compatibility
        for any new features used in the bootstrap code that were introduced
        since it was created.  This is facilitated by Ren-C's compositional
        operations, like ADAPT, CHAIN, SPECIALIZE, and ENCLOSE.
    }
    Notes: {
        * Version 8994d23 does not allow WORD!-access of NULL, because the null
        state was conflated with the "unset" state at that time.  This is
        not something that can be overridden by a shim.  So the easiest way
        to do `null? var` in a forward-compatible way is `null? get 'var`, but
        if the intent is on a variable that would be considered actually
        "unset" in modern versions then use `unset?` (it will be null though)

        * There was an issue with the Linux bootstrap executable not working
        on GitHub Actions, due to some strange issue with the binary and the
        container.  Rebuilding with a newer version of GCC seemed to resolve
        that, but Linux executables compiled circa 2018 in the wild may not
        work on some modern systems.
